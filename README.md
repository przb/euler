This is my personal repository for working on the challenges from https://projecteuler.net/. I find these challenges great to start solving problems in other languages.
Most of my curent solutions are very unoptimized and naive. I know this. Once I have the willpower, and the correct knowledge, I will go through and optimize the code.
**This is very much a work in progress**

**Todos**
* Optimize all the solutions
* Solve Problem 11
