# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers,
#  a < b < c, for which, a^2 + b^2 = c^2
# 
# For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.
# 
# There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
# Find the product abc.


# Found this online for finding pythagorean triples
# When m and n are any two positive integers (m > n):
#
#    a = m^2 âˆ’ n^2
#    b = 2mn
#    c = m^2 + n^2


# Turning into code what is written above, as a function. returns as a list
